# Trinity Health Zambia - Development Progress Tracker (2025)

## Development Strategy Overview

### Modern Development + Flexible Deployment Approach

**Philosophy**: Professional developer experience with flexible, cost-effective deployment options

**Production Deployment**: Choose between modern VPS hosting or traditional shared hosting  
**Cost**: Enterprise-grade development workflow with deployment options from R780-R1,788/year

---

## Design & User Experience Strategy

### **Design Inspiration: Mayo Clinic Website**
- **Primary Reference**: [mayoclinic.org](https://mayoclinic.org) - Clean, professional, trustworthy healthcare design
- **Key Design Elements to Adopt**:
  - Clean, clinical aesthetics with plenty of white space
  - Professional colour palette (adapting Mayo's blues to Trinity's maroon #880005)
  - Clear service categorisation and navigation
  - Prominent calls-to-action for appointments/consultations
  - Trust indicators (certifications, doctor credentials, testimonials)
  - Accessibility-first design approach
  - Mobile-responsive patient experience

### **Trinity Health Adaptations**:
- **Colour Scheme**: Primary #880005 (maroon) replacing Mayo's blue palette
- **Local Context**: Zambian healthcare landscape and cultural considerations
- **Dual Specialisation**: General health + audiology services (vs Mayo's broader specialties)
- **Scale**: Boutique practice feel vs large hospital system
- **Currency**: Zambian Kwacha (ZMK) pricing and local payment methods
